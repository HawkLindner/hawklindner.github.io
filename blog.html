                        I began youtube back on July 22 of 2022, where I began doing live streams on games
                        such as Super Smash Brothers and Rocket League! The first video I made was a 
                        Welcome to my chanel which is now privated but that was my first experience on 
                        the internet for posting videos. I started editing my first video that was a 
                        Splatoon 2 gameplay video on my Macbook using IMovie as I was not sure how invested
                        I wanted to get into the youtubes. I started introducing my friends to my channel
                        and started growing the community of some 20-30 people. The breakthrough for me was 
                        on August 25, 2022 where I hosted a 4 and a half hour live stream about playing 
                        Splatoon with my community and this was the largest viewcount and chat rate I have had 
                        on a Live. I hit 822 Views on this live stream and started getting momentumn towards 100 
                        subscribers. I hit my first 100 Subscribers on September 5th 2022 which was about 2 months
                        after I started my channel. As of right now, Febuary 18 2024 I sit at 143 Subscribers and 
                        have been enjoying creating content. A lot of life changing things had happened through the 
                        last year but video editing and content creation still is a sure go to for me when things 
                        get weird.
